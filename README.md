A silly little one time pad exercise, using the MicaliSchnorr CSPRBG as given by Algorithm 5.37 in
"Handbook of Applied Cryptography" by Menezes et al.

The gmp library (https://gmplib.org) is required.

Run:
gcc -o encrypt.exe encrypt.c -lgmp
gcc -o decrypt.exe decrypt.c -lgmp

Create a file named "msg.in", in the same directory as the 2 executables.

Run:
encrypt.exe
and the encrypted file is written to msg.enc.

Run:
decrypt.exe
and the encrypted "msg.enc" is decrypted into "msg.dec", where "msg.dec" is identical to "msg.in".

Decryption requires only that the same "primes.in" as was used to encrypt the message is available.

Security relies on "primes.in" being unavailable to potential attackers.
Even if an attacker has decrypt.exe at his disposal, it is useless without the information that is
provided by "primes.in".

A suitable "primes.in" can be generated by running genprime.exe. (See the comments in genprime.c)
There is, however, already a "primes.in" provided in this repo, for the purposes of demonstration.

And there's a perl test script (test.pl) which can be run to test that the encrypted file does,
indeed, decrypt back to the original file (which is autogenerated pseudorandomly by test.pl).
